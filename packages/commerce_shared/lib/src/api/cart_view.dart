/// A cart as a client sees it: the cart, and every total the server worked out.

/// This lives in the shared package rather than the server because it is a
/// contract, not an implementation. The server encodes this class and the
/// client decodes this class, so a field added here reaches both ends and a
/// field renamed breaks both at compile time — which is the point of the
/// whole repository.
///
/// The totals travel rather than being recomputed on the client. A storefront
/// that adds up its own lines will one day disagree with the receipt, and the
/// server's answer is the one the customer is charged.
