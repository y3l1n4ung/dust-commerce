# Inside handler/, service/ and repository/ there are five permitted file names
# and no others, plus the barrel named after the folder. A rule written down and
# never checked is a rule that lasts until the first hurry.
#
# Only the layer's immediate children are checked. An operation that outgrows
# the line budget becomes a folder of the same name, and the files inside it are
# that operation's breakdown — they are named for what they hold, because they
# are not operations. update/line.dart, update/shipping.dart and
# update/promotion.dart are the three things a cart update can be.
